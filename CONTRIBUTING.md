## How to Submit Changes

1. **Fork** the repository.
2. **Create a branch** from `main` with a descriptive name (e.g., `add-gitlab-ci-example`).
3. **Make your changes.** Follow the style and structure of existing documents.
4. **Test locally** — if you changed the assessment tool, open `public/assessment/index.html` in a browser and verify it works.
5. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description of what you changed and why.

## Content Guidelines

- **Be specific and actionable.** Vague guidance ("use best practices") is not helpful.
- **Stay vendor-neutral where possible.** The model should work regardless of which AI agent an org uses.
- **Include evidence expectations.** When defining a practice, describe what evidence would prove it's in place.
- **Keep the audience in mind.** Readers are engineering leaders, platform engineers, and security/compliance professionals — not AI researchers.
- **Use plain language.** Avoid jargon that isn't defined in the document.

## Style Guide

- Use ATX-style headings (`#`, `##`, `###`).
- Use tables for structured comparisons.
- Use code fences for file contents, CLI commands, and configuration examples.
- One sentence per line in Markdown source (makes diffs cleaner).
- Spell out acronyms on first use within each document.
